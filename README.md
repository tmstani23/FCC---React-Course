# FCC---React-Course
An in-depth  React and JSX course delivered by FreeCodeCamp.  This repo contains my code journey through the course.

Each of the files includes challenges/examples and are mounted to a separate div in the DOM.
Each section represents a different file and its examples are marked in different colors.

## Notes on Use:
Clone the repo and run the html file locally.

To view each example, within a file, uncomment the component in the ReactDOM.render() method.
Only one component can be rendered at a time.  Make sure the others are commented out.
